# Simulink Viewer
Simulink Viewer is a software tool that can read Simulink MDL files and display their contents in a user-friendly way using a Java-based graphical user interface (GUI).

## Motivation
The aim of this project is to develop a software tool that can read Simulink MDL files and display their contents in a user-friendly way using a Java-based graphical user interface (GUI). Simulink is a popular simulation and modeling environment used in various industries, including automotive, aerospace, and electronics. The Simulink MDL files contain the model information, which is used to simulate and analyze the system behavior.

The tool will provide users with the ability to load Simulink MDL files and view their contents in a hierarchical structure. The GUI will allow users to navigate through the model components and see their properties and connections. 

The software consists of two main components: a Simulink MDL file parser and a Java-based GUI. The parser will be responsible for reading the MDL file and extracting the model information, including the block diagram, parameters, and connections. The GUI will provide a user-friendly interface for displaying the model.

## Features
Key features of the software tool include:

- Loading and parsing Simulink MDL files
- Displaying the Simulink model in a hierarchical structure
- Navigating through the model components and seeing their properties and connections

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 11 or higher.
- You will need to use `javafx` package for this tool.

### Building the Project

- Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/MariamH78/Simulink-Viewer.git`
- Navigate to the project directory:
`cd <your directory>`
or Open the project folder in your preferred IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
  
    
__Note 1:__ Make sure to configure your VM's `module-path` to allow JavaFX apps.
  
__Note 2:__ JavaFX is an external library, you will need to include it in your new project's `lib` folder.
  

## Usage
To run the software, follow these steps:

- Launch the software by running the `simple_simulink.java` file as a Java application.
- Once it runs, enter the name of the selected MDL file. Make sure to enter the file's path correctly if it's not in the working directory.
- The software will parse the MDL file and display the Simulink model in a hierarchical structure.
